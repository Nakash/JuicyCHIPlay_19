	abstract = {Juicy design refers to the idea that large amounts of audiovisual feedback contribute to a positive player experience. While the concept is popular in the game design community, definitions of the concept remain vague, and it is difficult to analyze which elements contribute to whether a game is perceived as juicy. In this paper, we address this issue through a combination of industry perspectives and academic analysis to provide a more detailed understanding of contributors to juicy design. We present results from an online survey that received responses from 17 game developers, and create an affinity diagram to derive a framework that facilitates the analysis of juicy design rooted in developers’ perspectives. Through application to two commercially available games, we refine the framework, and contribute a tool that makes the idea of juiciness actionable for researchers and designers.},

abstract="In this paper, an investigation and its results towards brain activity pattern recognition while playing computer games using a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) device is presented. The main aim of the study was to analyse data recorded while participants were engaged in playing popular computer games. The major contribution of the analysis presented is the confirmation of the hypothesis that there is a connection between activities in the brain and the different categories of computer games. Three different popular computer games were used, and the recordings took place under the conditions imposed by two different environments, a noisy one (a typical open-access university computer lab) and a quiet one (a typical controlled-access university computer lab under controlled environmental parameters). Initial results, obtained after analysing the raw electro-encephalography (EEG) recorded data, suggest that there might be a significant connection between the type of activity taking place in the human brain and the type of computer game a player is engaging with.",
